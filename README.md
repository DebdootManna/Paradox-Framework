Report Overview
The application is based on a theoretical report titled "Paradox Framework," which explores:

The enduring challenge of paradoxes and the role of self-reference.

Foundational paradoxes like the Liar, Russell's, GÃ¶del's, and Montague's theorems.

The constructive paradigm, embracing self-reference in computer science and AI.

Interdisciplinary manifestations of paradoxes in systems theory, organizational theory, and cognitive science.

A unified framework for synthesizing these diverse perspectives and outlining future research directions.
